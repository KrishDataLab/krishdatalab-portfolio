# KrishDataLab – Data Analytics Portfolio

KrishDataLab is my personal data analytics portfolio where I showcase real-world projects focused on transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights.

I work with SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to analyze datasets, build dashboards, and communicate findings in a business-friendly way. This repository documents my learning journey through hands-on projects, case studies, and continuous improvements.

## 🔹 What You’ll Find Here
- Excel-based analysis and reporting projects  
- SQL projects focused on data querying and insights  
- Interactive dashboards using Power BI  
- Python projects for data analysis, automation, and modeling  
- Machine learning fundamentals and predictive models  

## 🔹 Skills & Tools
- Data Analysis & Visualization  
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Business Queries)  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Reporting)  
- Power BI (Dashboards & Storytelling)  

## 🔹 Philosophy
I believe in learning by building, documenting my work in public, and improving one step at a time. Every project here reflects practical problem-solving rather than theory alone.
